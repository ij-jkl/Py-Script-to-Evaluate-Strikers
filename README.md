# Py-Script-to-Evaluate-Strikers
This Python script is designed to process large datasets from an Excel file, assessing each player to generate ratings and identify the top strikers. It automates the evaluation of numerous players, although it's worth noting that this project is still a work in progress.

Areas for potential improvement include:

- Incorporating databases to efficiently store and organize data.
- Implementing a user interface that allows filtering by criteria such as scores, market value, age, etc.
- Expanding the evaluation beyond just strikers to cover other positions as well.
Once you run this Python script, a new Excel file named strikersRating.xlsx will be generated. The file will include all the calculated statistics and the per 90-minutes stats of the game. Finally, you will see the total score, which will likely be higher than 100 and presented on a normalized scale as another statistic.
