# Py-Script-to-Evaluate-Strikers
This Python script is designed to process large datasets from an Excel file, assessing each player to generate ratings and identify the top strikers. It automates the evaluation of numerous players, although it's worth noting that this project is still a work in progress.

Areas for potential improvement include:

- Incorporating databases to efficiently store and organize data.
- Implementing a user interface that allows filtering by criteria such as scores, market value, age, etc.
- Expanding the evaluation beyond just strikers to cover other positions as well.
